## About

GeoBox is a game engine for the indie game Cave Story. It's also used in Them's Fightin' Herds for pixellobbies and Story Mode overworld maps

It promised the following features (according to the thread):

- Live world editing (aka, in game world editing)
- Full script system in Lua (class creation, level scripting, inheritance from C++ classes)
- Script can be recompiled while the game is running to enable rapid prototyping and parameter testing
- Overwrite protection for files (engine backs up any file it recycles)
- Performance diagnostics tools
- Full Lua IDE with autocomplete enabled
- Runtime lua debugging tools
- NavGraphs for NPC AI
- Object Oriented lua programming
- Physics engine powered by Chipmunk2D
- Subsystems such as physics and lighting take advantage of multicore systems
- UPD and TCP networking are functional (but still in the works)
